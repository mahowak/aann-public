        <p>DO NOT COMPLETE THIS SURVEY MORE THAN ONCE. YOU WILL NOT BE PAID FOR MULTIPLE HITS.
            Do not complete any surveys wwith the code LUCID LEOPARD more than once.
            Please rate the sentences according to if they are acceptable. Focus on if the sentence
        sounds natural as an English sentence, and NOT on if the sentence is likely to occur.
        For instance, "The cat sailed on a glittery sailboat." is not likely but is grammatical.
        You should give this sentence a high rating: a 10.
        But a sentence like "The cat sail on boat." is not acceptable English and should receive a low rating, a 1, 2, or 3.
        
        Some sentences will be clearly acceptable or unacceptable, whereas others may not be so clear.
        NOTE: If you are clearly not doing the task in earnest, your HIT will be rejected.
